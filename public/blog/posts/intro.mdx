# Introduction

I created this blog because I want to share tips & tricks for memorization along with memorize.ai's journey to success. In a later blog post, I'll talk about how the algorithm works and give you a peek inside what's happening behind the scenes.

# Formatting

I've implemented some formatting in this blog. You can write syntax-highlighted code!

[Here's a link to memorize.ai](https://memorize.ai)

[Another link, but this one is for this blog's code](https://github.com/memorize-ai/web/tree/master/public/blog)

> _"memorize.ai is truly the ultimate memorization platform"_ - memorize.ai

```cpp
cout << "Is memorize.ai the ultimate memorization platform? ";

string answer;
cin >> answer;

if (answer == "no")
	cout << "Wrong answer!";
```

```css
/* How do I center a div??? */
div {
	center: yes;
}
```

What's this? `<?php echo "Hey look, inline code!"; ?>`

You can use [Filein](https://file-in.web.app) (another service I made) to upload images:
